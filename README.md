## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

TODO : and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

    - The vehical weight had a non-random level of significance because it had a P-Value of 0.07756

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

    - The slope of the linear regression model is not zero becasue of the strength of the coraltion of the independent and dependent variables. Because the stength R-squared has a strong strength of coralation it the relationship between the points can not be explained by random chance or error. 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    
    - The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively becasue the R-squared value of 0.7149, and the p-value of 5.35e-11 can not be explained by randomness or errors. Using this linear regression model would be effective in predicting future data points.
